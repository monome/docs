# grid studies

The grid is *intended* to be reimagined. You give it purpose and meaning that's all your own: instrument, experiment, tool, toy... choose your own adventure! Let's start with some introductory knowledge: potential energy for radical creative freedom.

The following tutorials show how to use different languages and environments to achieve the same goal: a playable step sequencer which interfaces with the grid.

- [Max](/docs/grid/studies/max) -- a highly refined graphical patching environment.
- [Arduino](/docs/grid/studies/arduino) -- embedded programming to connect grids to external hardware.
- [Processing](/docs/grid/studies/processing) -- integrated development environment for visual experimentation.
- [Puredata](/docs/grid/studies/pd) -- open-source graphical patching for audio processing.
- [SuperCollider](/docs/grid/studies/sc) -- synthesis engine and programming environment.
- [Python](/docs/grid/studies/python) -- general purpose programming language.
- [Node.js](/docs/grid/studies/nodejs) -- web-centric script programming platform.
