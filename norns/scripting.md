# scripting

*Code as musical language.*

Scripts describe to norns how it should function. Through scripts, an encoder can become a scrollable playhead, a button might trigger a flurry of arpeggios, The screen can become a portal.

You don't need to know how to program before you're able to write a script. Wanting to learn is the only true prerequisite, the same as any other language. 

To help bridge the gap for non-coding artists, we've developed and collected a number of norns-specific resources. Through these pages, you'll learn more about the approachable programming interface at the core of norns:

- [studies](../studies) // comprehensive tutorials on individual components of norns, highly beginner-friendly
- [reference](../reference) // an example-centric version of the norns API, for advanced use
