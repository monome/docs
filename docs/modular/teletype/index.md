# Teletype

Algorithmic ecosystem: a dynamic, musical event triggering platform.

Scripts are assigned to each of the eight trigger inputs. Herein you can set CV values (four outputs) and trigger gates (four outputs) with extended functionality for pattern manipulation, slews, randomness, sequences, basic arithmetic, stacks, delays, and much more.

Edit scripts with a USB keyboard which plugs into the front panel. Syntax is simple and easy to learn with the provided tutorials, video, and reference pages. Teletype runs without the keyboard attached: you might treat editing as precomposition, or leave the keyboard plugged in for live coding.

### Specifications

* Eurorack
* 18hp width
* 26mm depth 

## Installation

Align the 10-pin ribbon cable so the red stripe corresponds to the white indicator on the rear of the module’s circuit board. This is toward the lower edge of the module.

Be careful not to misalign the connector left-to-right either – while Teletype is protected against incorrect connection, doing so may damage other modules in your Eurorack case.

If you wish Teletype to communicate with Ansible or other modules with II, you will need to attach the II ribbon cable as outlined in the [II Communication](http://monome.org/docs/modular/iiheader/) page.

Secure the module with the four included screws, hiding under the tape in the box lid.

*Power consumption:*

- 72mA @ +12V
- 12ma @ -12V
- No +5v required

**[Firmware updates](/docs/modular/update) may be available. The currently installed firmware version is displayed at startup.**

It is possible to backup all your presets as part of the module's firmware; see [modular firmware updates](/docs/modular/update/).

## Further

Teletype is [open-source](https://github.com/monome/teletype). Since its initial release Teletype has grown an improved extensively thanks to various contributors including @sam, @scanner_darkly, and @sliderule. Additionally the documentation has undergone full reworking.
