# sequins v2
{: .no_toc }

The `sequins` library is designed for building sequencers, arpeggiators and all sorts of other pattern systems. This new version adds to the original with *transformers* for simple pattern synthesis, and also streamlines some syntax for character-patterns.

For a quick refresher on v1, see [the scripting reference](/docs/crow/reference/#sequins) and [its entry in the norns reference](/docs/norns/reference/lib/sequins).

Now, onto the new!

## sequins-strings

This feature is inspired by [foxdot](https://foxdot.org)'s sample patterns, as used in a [Flash Crash performance by mgs](https://youtu.be/A0ryZjW90Bo?t=258). The core idea is a string which assigns different events to different characters.

For `sequins`, this just leads to a simple syntax shortcut where you replace the normal table-of-values (eg. `sequins{x,y,z}`) with a *string*. This turns each character of the string into an element of the `sequins`:

```lua
char_sequence = sequins"+ - + . "
char_sequence() --> '+'
char_sequence() --> ' '
char_sequence() --> '-'
                -- etc.
```

When using these `sequins`-strings, you'll need to build a function that takes a character & does something special with it. Using spaces in a `sequins` string is a great way to clearly add sonic whitespace to a pattern.

```lua
function make_sound(char)
  if     char == '+' then output[1](pulse())
  elseif char == '-' then output[2](ar())
  elseif char == '~' then output[1](lfo())
  elseif char == '.' then output[1].volts = 0
  end -- note that spaces are ignored!
end

char_sequence = sequins"+ -~ ."
make_sound(char_sequence()) -- + -> pulses output 1
make_sound(char_sequence()) -- space -> does nothing
make_sound(char_sequence()) -- - -> creates envelope on output 2
make_sound(char_sequence()) -- ~ -> starts an lfo on output 1
make_sound(char_sequence()) -- space -> does nothing
make_sound(char_sequence()) -- . -> sets output 1 to 0V, thus stopping the lfo
```

Of course, the `sequins` v1 flow modifiers are still available so you can manipulate your pattern in interesting ways:

```lua
-- the following 2 lines are the same! this is special Lua function-call syntax.
chs = sequins"A  a!"
chs = sequins("A  a!")

-- calling chs() repeatedly produces the sequence:
--  'A', ' ', ' ', 'a', '!', 'A', etc

-- use the :step method to step forward two elements at a time:
chs = sequins "A  a!":step(2)
chs() --> 'A', ' ', '!', ' ', 'a', 'A', etc
```

`sequins` offers other methods for flow-modification, but only when multiple patterns are nested. While this is absolutely possible with `sequins`-strings,  you'll lose the primary benefit of having one character space equal to one event. Instead, try deploying multiple parallel `sequins` that interleave elements, or phase against each other in polyrhythms, as in this example:

```lua
-- two sequins with length 7 and 8.
seq_a = sequins"+  +  +0"
seq_b = sequins"R +   ."

-- add your own make_sound function to handle the above characters!

-- execute both sequences at once, every beat
-- the 2 sequences will phase against one another
clock.run(function()
  while true do
  	clock.sync(1)
  	make_sound(seq_a())
  	make_sound(seq_b())
  end
end)
```

## Transformers

While `sequins` has always been about taking a pattern and manipulating how you move through it, *transformers* are all about changing the data inside of the pattern. This allows you to write your data in a legible way, but then manipulate it into a different form for some other use (eg. note values -> volts). Or it can be used for more drastic manipulation of the data itself!

Transformers are applied with the new `:map` method chained onto your `sequins`. Whenever your `sequins` is called, the value produced is transformed by the `map` function before being returned.

### Utilitarian Usage

We'll start with some simple arithmetic operations. One very common usage is to convert 12TET note values (Ã  la {0,4,7} for a major triad) into their voltage equivalents. Here, we convert note-numbers into voltages for use with `ii`:

```lua
my_seq = sequins{0,3,0,2,7}:map(function(n) return n/12 end)

-- now we can just use the `sequins` directly
ii.jf.play_note(my_seq(), 2)
```

In this case it might seem just as easy to apply the division when creating the note on just friends, but the benefit here is that we can now think about `my_seq` as being a `sequins` of *voltages*, rather than notes.

In a similar way, we might want to express our `sequins` as just-intonation ratios. Here we can change `my_seq` without having to touch the code that plays the notes, by using our [`justvolts` global](/docs/crow/reference/#globals):

```lua
my_seq = sequins{1/1, 3/2, 8/5, 4/3}:map(justvolts)

-- note how this next line is identical to above
-- thus we can freely change the note data without modifying our playback code
ii.jf.play_note(my_seq(), 2)
```

### Arithmetic Operators

When you want to apply a single arithmetic operation to your sequence (like our note values -> volts conversion) you can simply use the *arithmetic operators* shortcut syntax.

The available arithmetic operations are `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and `%`.

It might look a little weird, but just remember that behind the scenes, the math operation is being applied via the `:map` method:

```lua
my_seq = sequins{0,3,0,2,7}/12 -- divide-by-12 will be applied as the transformer

ii.jf.play_note(my_seq(), 2)
```

This syntax is also useful if you want to apply a simple transposition:
```lua
my_seq = sequins{0,3,0,2,7}+2 -- shift up by 2 semi-tones

ii.jf.play_note(my_seq()/12, 2) -- note we had to put the /12 down here though...
```

Using the new `hotswap` library will let you change this more rapidly (see [hotswap](/docs/crow/hotswap).

### Pattern Manipulation

Let's get into more involved transformations. The `:map` function is just a regular Lua function with one argument: the value to be transformed. This means that the *entire* Lua language is available to you. Here, we inject some randomness to probabilistically add an octave to the notes:

```lua
my_seq = sequins{0,3,0,2,7}:map(function(n) return n + (math.random() > 0.5) and 12 or 0 end)
```

This line is a little lengthy, so let's break our transformer out into its own function:

```lua
function maybe_octave(n)
	if math.random() > 0.5 then
		return n + 12
	else return n end
end

my_seq = sequins{0,3,0,2,7}:map(maybe_octave) -- this clarifies our intent
```

You could also use conditionals to change values based on an external signal through one of crow's inputs:

```lua
function major_minor(n)
	if input[1].volts > 2 then -- switch to minor tonality if input 1 above 2V
		if     n == 4  then return 3
		elseif n == 11 then return 10
		end
	else return n end -- otherwise leave untouched
end

my_seq = sequins{0,4,7,11,14}:map(major_minor)
```

We can also use external storage to do some statistical analysis of a `sequins`. This example returns the median of the last 3 values which might be... useful?

```lua
local previous = {0,0,0} -- store the last 3 values

function median(n)
	table.remove(previous, 3) -- remove the last element
	table.insert(previous, n) -- add the new element

	-- copy the table so we can sort it
	local t = {}
	for i=1,3 do t[i] = previous[i] end
	table.sort(t) -- sort the table

	-- return the middle element which will be the median
	return t[2]
end

my_seq = sequins{0,10,4,3,7,11,3,4,14}:map(median)
```

### sequins As Operators

Extending the [arithmetic operators](#arithmetic-operators) from above, we can create some very interesting combinations by using a second `sequins` on the right-hand-side of the operation:

```lua
my_seq = sequins{0,7,2,9,4} + sequins{0,0,-12,12}
my_seq() --> this would be a nice long pattern jumping up and down octaves
```

Above, the second `sequins` is placed inside of the first's `:map` thanks to our arithmetic operators. The equivalent non-operator version is:

```lua
my_seq = sequins{0,7,2,9,4}
			:map(function(n, sq) -- we can pass additional args!
			        return n + sq()
			    end, sequins{0,0,-12,12})
```

You may be tempted to chain multiple `sequins` together with `+`, but remember that we can only apply *one* arithmetic operation with this syntax. If you want to delve more deeply into this, you'll need to write the full `:map` method as shown immediately above.

### Cancelling a Transformer

At some point you may want to remove the current transformer. To do so, you can simply call `:map` with no argument to unset the transformer:

```lua
my_seq = sequins{0,3,0,2,7}:map(function(n) return n + (math.random() > 0.5) and 12 or 0 end)
my_seq() --> provides some fun octave switching

my_seq:map() -- remove the map transformer
my_seq() --> provides the original sequence again
```

## Save Your Work

`sequins` transformers are designed to be used to gradually build up ideas over time. By incrementally modifying the `sequins` data, flow-modifiers, and map-transformer, you'll hopefully get to a new place that you'd like to capture in its own right.

As of v2, there are 3 ways to "copy" a `sequins`, each having a different result.

The first option is to simply copy around the *name* of the `sequins` (eg. `seq` in `seq = sequins{1,2,3}`). This doesn't actually *copy* anything, but just passes around a reference to the `sequins` object. Wherever you call the name, the `sequins` will advance a step forward and return a new value. This lets you define a `sequins` in one place, and use it in another.

### :copy

To make an independent copy of `sequins`, we can use the `:copy` method:

```lua
my_seq = sequins{1,4,9,16,25}
my_copy = my_seq:copy()

my_seq() --> 1
my_seq() --> 4
my_seq() --> 9
my_copy() --> 1
my_copy() --> 4
```

Here we can see that the original and copy have their own indices that are independent of each other. This could be useful if you want to use the same melody played by two instruments with different rhythm or tempo.

When using `:copy`, *everything* is copied into the new variable. this includes flow-modifiers (eg `:every`), and transformers. This is useful if you have found a nice configuration that you want to keep around: make a copy of it and set it to the side, then keep working on your original. This is similar to the "Save a Copy" feature in many PC applications.

### :bake

At some point you'll likely find a `sequins` that you love, but perhaps it's already using a transformer and you want to add another without adding a bunch of text. Or maybe the `sequins` sounds great for a little while, but becomes weird or loses a sense of rhythm after some time. This is where the `:bake` method comes in as a new way to copy `sequins`.

Baking a `sequins` captures the output data for a defined number of steps, and places it into a new, independent `sequins`.

```lua
patt = sequins{0,7,2,9,4} + sequins{0,12}
patt() --> creates a nice sequence of notes, looping every 10 elements

cake = patt:bake(32) -- capture the first 32 elements of patt
cake() --> same as patt() but loops after 32 elements
```

Now `cake` can be used just like `patt` but because it's been baked, it will loop after 32 steps. This will truncate the fourth repetition of the note sequence which might be just the amount of poly-rhythm you're looking for.

You can now add a new transformer to `cake` to further take it in a new direction!

## Other New Goodies

Along with the `sequins`-strings and `:map`-transformers, v2 also has some nice quality-of-life improvements to make working with `sequins` a little easier:

### Visualizing

Previously, calling `print(my_sequins)` would return something like `table 0x38746373`. We've updated this behavior so that `print`ing a `sequins` will give you information about both the *values* and the *index state(s)* of the `sequins`:

```lua
s1 = sequins{1,2,sequins{3,4}}
for i=1,5 do s1() end -- step forward 5 steps

print(s1) --> s[2]{1,2,s[2]{3,4}}
```

We can break down this printout into the following elements:

* `s`: this is a `sequins`
* `[2]`: we're at index 2
* `{1,2,...}` these are the values in the `sequins`
* `s[2]{3,4}` the state of the nested `sequins`

When you get deeply nested the printout can be a little hard to read, but it should bear a close resemblance to your original `sequins`, useful for reference.

If you have flow modifiers or transformers applied, they will be shown.  
Here, `:every` is shortened to `:e`:

```lua
patt = sequins{0,7,2,9,4}:every(3)

print(patt) --> s[1]{0,7,2,9,4}:e[0](3)
```

And `:map` is shown as the underlying transformer:

```lua
patt = sequins{0,7,2,9,4} + sequins{0,0,12,12}
s[1]{0,7,2,9,4}:map(fn,s[1]{0,0,12,12})
```

### Length

If you call the `#` (length) operator on a `sequins`, it will now return the number of elements at the top-layer of the `sequins`. If you have nested `sequins`, each nest will count as one element:

```lua
s1 = sequins{1,2,3}
print(#s1) --> 3

s2 = sequins{1,2,sequins{3,4}} -- nested sequins only count as a single element
print(#s2) --> 3
```

### :peek

If you're using a `sequins` in multiple places but only want it to be advanced in one location, you can use the `:peek` method (thanks to `@tyleretters`). This is especially useful if you want to find the current value to print on screen (eg. on norns):


```lua
s1 = sequins{0,3,9,7}
s1() -- start with first index
s1() -- move to second index

print(s1:peek()) --> 3
```
