[an overview of the concepts that will be covered](https://youtu.be/WQyoDRRQ5Qg?t=1701):

- sequins
- clocks
- between the two: instant sequencer-style things

within the episode, Trent executes crow commands via druid on the left side of the screen while taking longform notes in a [text editor](https://www.sublimetext.com) on the right side of the screen. also within the episode, Trent receives a package -- it is unknown what the package contains. perhaps it's unimportant, but it seems to have captured the imagination of the live viewers.

## clean slate

to begin, let's make sure our crow isn't doing anything else but what we tell it to by executing the following in druid:

```lua
crow.reset()
```

## making events happen in musical time

crow v3 borrows the concept of a 'clock' from norns. this just means that crow has a built-in understanding of tempo (eg. 98 bpm), which means you can execute events on a quantized beat/tick (either on a recurring timed loop or as a single execution). these events can be notes or modulations or *anything* you want -- the important thing is that you can lock these to occur in musical time. this is super rad, because it allows you execute part of a program in specified intervals, whereas 'normal' program flow tries to execute all events as instantaneously as possible.

we do this by using a function named `clock.run`, which lets crow know to look out for a few things:

- an event we'd like to execute in musical time
- to which beat interval we'd like to sync this event's execution
- whether that event should execute again and again, or just once

[watch Trent explain and set up a `clock.run` function](https://youtu.be/WQyoDRRQ5Qg?t=1789). note that Trent is writing this in the text editor, which can be uploaded to crow as a script later on. for the purposes of this document, we'll be executing single lines via druid.

### check + change tempo

to check the current tempo of your crow, execute:

```lua
print(clock.tempo)
```

to change the tempo to (for example) 150 bpm, simply execute:

```lua
clock.tempo = 150
```

since `clock.tempo` is just a variable, it can also be used in equations like this:

```lua
ii.wdel.time(60/clock.tempo) -- sets w/'s delay time to a quarter note length at the current bpm
```

or like this:

```lua
clock.tempo = clock.tempo/2
```

### make a note every beat

[at this point in the video](https://youtu.be/WQyoDRRQ5Qg?t=1919), Trent uses a special protocol and command to communicate to another module's (w/) digital synthesis mode:

```lua
clock.run(function() while true do clock.sync(1); ii.wysn.play_note(0,0.9) end end)
```

if you don't have access to this module, here's a version of the code he's written which will send v/8 CV to crow output 1 and a trigger pulse to crow output 2:

```lua
clock.run(function() while true do clock.sync(1); output[1].volts = 0.9; output[2](pulse()) end end)
```

to clear all running clocks, execute:

```lua
clock.cleanup()
```

## establishing a sequence with *sequins*

[watch Trent get bored](https://youtu.be/WQyoDRRQ5Qg?t=2060) and figure out how to solve his boredom with *sequins*.

*sequins* is a library that's built in crow v3. it provides a framework to store values, sequence them, and pass these values to other functions across crowspace.

to define a sequence, we create a variable which stores and accesses a *sequins*. try executing this in druid:

```lua
mys = sequins{0,2,4,7,9}
```

this establishes `mys` as a *sequins*-capable function. we assigned `mys` a table of semitones, which will automatically be stepped through every time we execute `mys()`.

so, to iterate through the table, execute:

```lua
print( mys() )
```

...again and again and again.

you'll get:

```bash
> print( mys() )
0

> print( mys() )
2

> print( mys() )
4
```

every time we execute `mys()`, it will return the next step's value, eg:

```bash
> print( mys(), mys(), mys() )
7 9 0 
```

while it's easier to think about sequences in semitones, you'll often want to pass raw voltage to your crow destinations. to convert a semitone to voltage, just divide it by 12, eg

```bash
> print( mys()/12 )
0.3333333
```

## running our sequence

[watch Trent spice things up](https://youtu.be/WQyoDRRQ5Qg?t=2387)

prettified w/syn code:

```lua
mys = sequins{0,2,4,7,9}

clock.run(
  function()
    while true do
      clock.sync(1)
      ii.wysn.play_note(mys()/12,0.9)
    end
  end
)
```

one-line w/syn code:

```lua
mys = sequins{0,2,4,7,9}; clock.run(function() while true do clock.sync(1); ii.wysn.play_note(mys()/12,0.9) end end)
```

if you don't have access to this module, here's a version of the code he's written which will send v/8 CV to crow output 1 and a trigger pulse to crow output 2.

prettified v/8 + pulse code:

```lua
mys = sequins{0,2,4,7,9}

clock.run(
  function()
    while true do
      clock.sync(1)
      output[1].volts = mys()/12
      output[2](pulse())
    end
  end
)
```

one-line v/8 + pulse code:

```lua
mys = sequins{0,2,4,7,9}; clock.run(function() while true do clock.sync(1); output[1].volts = mys()/12; output[2](pulse()) end end)
```

## changing sequence step size

[watch Trent change the size of the *sequins* step](https://youtu.be/WQyoDRRQ5Qg?t=2471)

to modify the step size of a *sequins* while its running, execute:

```lua
mys:step(2)
```

...which will increment by 2 steps instead of the default 1.

## creating 'presets' + switching between them

[watch Trent duplicate a *sequins* current configuration](https://youtu.be/WQyoDRRQ5Qg?t=2547)

since a *sequins* is just a variable (for us so far, `mys`), we can copy it for further experimentation or posterity very easily.

to make a copy of the current sequence, execute:

```lua
mys1 = mys
```

this allows us to freely redefine `mys` *while the sequence is running*:

```lua
mys = sequins{0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21}
```

notice that when we redefine `mys`, it steps by 1 (even if you had previously applied a step modification). this is because we are forcing `mys` to forget what it used to know, which includes the step size. if you execute:

```lua
mys = mys1
```

you'll get back to your previous settings, including any step size mods!

## *sequins*-ing time

[watch Trent use another *sequins* to modify `clock.sync`](https://youtu.be/WQyoDRRQ5Qg?t=2697)

let's stop our currently running clocks:

```lua
clock.cleanup()
```

and use `myt` to sequence the `clock.sync()` division while `mys` sequences pitch.

prettified w/syn code:

```lua
mys = sequins{0,2,4,7,9}
myt = sequins{1,1,1,1/2,1/2}

clock.run(
  function()
    while true do
      clock.sync(myt())
      ii.wysn.play_note(mys()/12,0.9)
    end
  end
)
```

one-line w/syn code:

```lua
mys = sequins{0,2,4,7,9}; myt = sequins{1,1,1,1/2,1/2}; clock.run(function() while true do clock.sync(myt()); ii.wysn.play_note(mys()/12,0.9) end end)
```

if you don't have access to this module, here's a version of the code he's written which will send v/8 CV to crow output 1 and a trigger pulse to crow output 2.

prettified v/8 + pulse code:

```lua
mys = sequins{0,2,4,7,9}
myt = sequins{1,1,1,1/2,1/2}

clock.run(
  function()
    while true do
      clock.sync(myt())
      output[1].volts = mys()/12
      output[2](pulse())
    end
  end
)
```

one-line v/8 + pulse code:

```lua
mys = sequins{0,2,4,7,9}; myt = sequins{1,1,1,1/2,1/2}; clock.run(function() while true do clock.sync(myt()); output[1].volts = mys()/12; output[2](pulse()) end end)
```

to get a little funky, try changing `myt`'s step size using what we've learned so far!

## replacing (only) the values in a *sequins*

[watch Trent replace the values in our time *sequins* without overwriting the other settings](https://youtu.be/WQyoDRRQ5Qg?t=2898)

to retain the current step and step size settings, but change the values in our `myt` *sequins*, execute:

```lua
myt:settable{1,1/2,1/2,1/4,1/4,1/8,1/8,1/4}
```

## additional techniques

for the rest of the episode, Trent digs into some extended techniques which mix + remix the concepts above. rather than repeat the baseline information which enables these explorations, we'll link to moments of particular impact:

- [storing scales in *sequins*](https://youtu.be/WQyoDRRQ5Qg?t=3715)
- [sequencing *sequins*](https://youtu.be/WQyoDRRQ5Qg?t=3831)
- [`:count`](https://youtu.be/WQyoDRRQ5Qg?t=3971), which captures focus and produces *n* values in a row before moving on to another *sequins*
- [*sequins*-ing a single position in a *sequins*](https://youtu.be/WQyoDRRQ5Qg?t=4151)
- [`:every`](https://youtu.be/WQyoDRRQ5Qg?t=4412), which produces a value every *nth* call
- [*sequins*-ing `:step`](https://youtu.be/WQyoDRRQ5Qg?t=4781)
- [creating modulation via `clock.sleep` and *sequins*](https://youtu.be/WQyoDRRQ5Qg?t=5378)
- [generating envelopes + LFOs with crow](https://youtu.be/WQyoDRRQ5Qg?t=5682)
- [generating chords with *sequins*](https://youtu.be/WQyoDRRQ5Qg?t=5984), which also showcases how *sequins* can store + call functions (as well as numbers + strings)
