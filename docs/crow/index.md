# Crow

(insert poetry.) Scriptable USB-CV-II machine.

(WHAT IS IT: satellite vs standalone)

A collaboration by Whimsical Raps and monome.


## Specifications

- Eurorack, 2hp width, 41mm depth
- Power consumption: 60mA @ +12v, -15mA @ -12V, no 5V
- 2 input, 4 output, 16bit [-5V,10V] range
- Rear II connector with switchable pullups
- 3.5mm stereo MIDI input on top jack

## Installation

Align the 10-pin ribbon cable so the red stripe corresponds to the white indicator on the rear of the moduleâ€™s circuit board. This is toward the lower edge of the module.

If you would like to use the II functionality, be sure to observe the orientation of the connector. The white stripe indicates GND.
