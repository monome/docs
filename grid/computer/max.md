# Max (macOS + Windows)
{: .no_toc }

The grid was originally designed as a flexible, minimal interface to control Max patchers. Over the past 15+ years many artists have extended this simple purpose into full-blown performance tools -- and due to the communal nature inherent to Max, have generously shared these patchers + standalone applications with others. This exchange of enthusiasm and care for other artists has always been staggering to us.

While grid's compatibility + potential with Max remains current, computing has changed quite a bit over the last decade and a half. Therefore, the projects contained in this section may have different levels of stability as OS + host application updates introduce breaking changes. If you feel particularly drawn to a tool which could use a bit of tweaking to get back in working order, that is a fantastic place to learn Max from! 

Max can be [downloaded and run for free](http://cycling74.com), without a license (a license is required to save your changes, however). In the section below, you'll also find many Max for Live devices, which can be run in Max for free (just drag the `.amxd` file directly into a patcher) or within Ableton's Live Suite (or using Ableton's Max for Live add-on).

* [anaphora](https://github.com/AndrewShike/anaphora) -- simple, live-input focused mlr variant.
* [anachronism](https://github.com/AndrewShike/anachronism) -- asynchronous digital tape looping interface.
* [versos](https://llllllll.co/t/31326) -- multi-track looper and sampler for grids with 64 keys.

### midi
* [max package](/docs/grid/app/package) -- several patchers and tools for use within Max, rolled by monome.
* [conway music](https://llllllll.co/t/32818) -- conway's game of life, midi-fied.
* [markov music](https://l.llllllll.co/markov/) -- make music with a simple Markov chain.

### arc-enabled
* [capstarc](https://github.com/mhetrick/capstarc) -- tactile sample scrubbing for arc.
* [cascades](https://l.llllllll.co/cascades/) -- 65,536 combinations of 16th note patterns across seven tracks.
* [pear](https://llllllll.co/t/32699) -- dual manual tape player for arc and Max.

### no grid or arc?

While we believe that grid and arc help inspire interesting and idiosyncratic design, we value the perspectives that lead to unique music-making experiences above all else. Here are some of the free projects that have been born out of the [lines community](https://llllllll.co) that can be run on your computer using Max / Max for Live without any additional hardware:

* [confetti](http://www.rodrigoconstanzo.com/confetti/) -- a library of audio processing devices based on Rodrigo Constanzo's Max projects.
* [prosody](https://github.com/AndrewShike/prosody) -- a modular collection audio effects with minimal design and maximal impact.
* [geneseq](https://llllllll.co/t/32237) -- a Max external that implements a genetic algorithm for simple 8 step melodies using scale degrees.
* [grainshifter](https://llllllll.co/t/32261) -- an highly playable granulator for live input or prerecorded samples.
* [less concepts](https://llllllll.co/t/31294) -- an elementary cellular automata sequencer.

## archived projects

[collected](https://github.com/monome-community/collected) is a large unsorted repository of applications contributed over the years. We've also collected numerous [old monomeserial applications](https://github.com/monome-community/collected-ms) which are basically obsolete, but could be updated easily given some small ambition.

## Max for Live

If you have access to Ableton Live Suite (or the Max for Live add-on for Live Standard), there are a number of Max for Live devices which integrate grid into your Live Sets.

- [terms](/docs/grid/app/terms): a collection of essential monome applications, synchronized and integrated within Ableton Live Suite (works with Live 11 / Live 10 / Live 9)
- [gridlab](https://github.com/stretta/gridlab): a suite of devices which collect a number of unique sequencers and utilities
- [grainfields](https://github.com/kasperskov/monome_grainfields_m4l-v1.1): eight-voice granulator with grid control
- [control](https://github.com/benjaminvanesser/control): transforms grid into a collection of assignable MIDI controls
- [elements](https://github.com/benjaminvanesser/elements) -- a collection of Max for Live midi controls for grids.
