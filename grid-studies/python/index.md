# Grid Studies: Python

By design the monome grid does nothing on its own. You the user assign it purpose and meaning: instrument, experiment, tool, toy... choose your own adventure. This grid is *intended* to be reimagined. Here we set forth to impart some introductory knowledge: potential energy for radical creative freedom.

Python is is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale. (from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)))

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes a basic familiarity with the Python langauge and its programing workflow. If you're very new to Python, check out the [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/).

Python 3.5 is required. See [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

Install pymonome: `pip3 install pymonome`

Download the code examples here: [github.com/monome/grid-studies-python/releases/latest](https://github.com/monome/grid-studies-python/releases/latest)

## 1. Connect and Basics

*See grid-studies-1.py for this section.*

```python
#! /usr/bin/env python3

import asyncio
import monome

class GridStudies(monome.GridApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('/monome')

    def on_grid_key(self, x, y, s):
        print("key:", x, y, s)
        self.grid.led_level_set(x, y, s*15)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    grid_studies = GridStudies()

    def serialosc_device_added(id, type, port):
        print('connecting to {} ({})'.format(id, type))
        asyncio.ensure_future(grid_studies.grid.connect('127.0.0.1', port))

    serialosc = monome.SerialOsc()
    serialosc.device_added_event.add_handler(serialosc_device_added)

    loop.run_until_complete(serialosc.connect())
    loop.run_forever()
```

The `pymonome` library simplifies communication with the grid.

Note that the example here consists of two parts. First, we describe the class `GridStudies` that inherits `monome.GridApp`. This class defines the behavior and properties of our grid-based application. Next, we setup the *serialosc* client, instantiate the application and start the main loop.

Python programs using `asyncio` require explicitly starting the event loop, so creating the loop is actually the first step our program takes:

```python
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
```

Next, we are creating the application instance:

```python
grid_studies = GridStudies()
```

In the next lines we define a callback to execute when serialosc detects a monome device. In this example the callback prints the device type and connects the grid port of the application to the newly discovered device. Note that opening a connection to the grid is an asynchronous operation. The `grid.connect` method returns a _coroutine_, so we can't call it directly. Instead, we schedule the coroutine execution using `asyncio.ensure_future()`:

```python
def serialosc_device_added(id, type, port):
    print('connecting to {} ({})'.format(id, type))
    asyncio.ensure_future(grid_studies.grid.connect('127.0.0.1', port))
```

The next step is to create a serialosc client and attach the callback for new devices:

```python
serialosc = monome.SerialOsc()
serialosc.device_added_event.add_handler(serialosc_device_added)
```

The next line establishes a connection to serialosc, also an asynchronous operation. It can either be scheduled using `asyncio.ensure_future` as above or wrapped in `loop.run_until_complete` which will cause the loop to run until connection is established:

```python
loop.run_until_complete(serialosc.connect())
```

Finally, we start our main loop with the last line:

```python
loop.run_forever()
```

After the loop is started, the library connects the first discovered device to our `GridStudies` object which is the primary definition of this application.

For a detailed description of how the *serialosc* mechanism and protocol work, see [monome.org/docs/tech:osc](http://monome.org/docs/tech:osc).

Let's take a look at our application class:

```python
class GridStudies(monome.GridApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
```

The constructor here simply calls the parent constructor without arguments. Because there is no additional code in the constructor, it can be omitted entirely, but we still have it declared in case we'll want to add some additional initialization logic to the application later.

### 1.1 Key input

The library calls the method `on_grid_key()` upon receiving input from the grid. It has three parameters.

    x : horizontal position (0-15)
    y : vertical position (0-7)
    s : state (1 = key down, 0 = key up)

Below we define the key function and simply print out incoming data.

```python
def on_grid_key(self, x, y, s):
    print("key:", x, y, s)
```

### 1.2 LED output

`GridStudies` is inherited from `monome.GridApp` which is a base class for grid-based applications. It exposes the grid via the `grid` property so we can actually do something with the grid, for example set a an LED value by calling `self.grid.led_level_set()`.

```python
self.grid.led_level_set(x, y, s * 15)
```

Here we send a new LED update per key event. Since `s` is either 0 or 1, when we multiply it by 15 we get off or full brightness. We set the LED location according to the position incoming key press, x and y.

## 2. Further

Now we'll show how basic grid applications are developed by creating a step sequencer. We will add features incrementally:

- Use the top six rows as toggles.
- Generate a clock pulse to advance the playhead from left to right, one column at a time. Wrap back to 0 at the end.
- Display the play head on "position" (last) row.
- Indicate the "activity" row (second to last) with a low brightness.
- Trigger an event when the playhead reads an "on" toggle. Our "event" will be to turn on the corresponding LED in the "activity" row.
- Jump to playback position when key pressed in the position row.
- Adjust playback loop with two-key gesture in position row.

### 2.1 Structure

We will have grid display refresh on a timer, which will later also serve as the play head. Below is the basic structure that our code will fit into:

```python
def on_grid_ready(self):
    # ...
    asyncio.async(self.play())

async def play(self):
    while True:
        # ...
        self.draw()
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
```

Note, that we define `play()` method with the `async` keyword. Thus, calling play() will return a coroutine, which we can schedule for execution using `asyncio.async(self.play())`.

The body of the while loop within the `play()` function will be executed every `0.1` seconds. `self.draw()` is where we refresh the grid display.

Key data will be processed as it comes in.

Furthermore, we'll use a subclass called `GridBuffer` for managing the display state. This section creates a buffer based on grid size:

```python
def on_grid_ready(self):
    self.buffer = monome.GridBuffer(self.grid.width, self.grid.height)
```

Instead of updating single LEDs at a time, we'll draw the entire grid and then render that to the hardware:

```python
# update grid
buffer.render(self.grid)
```

First let's make a bank of toggles for the sequencer.

### 2.1 Toggles

*See grid-studies-2-1.py for this section.*

First we'll create a new array called `step` that can hold 6 rows of step data, inside `ready()`:

```python
self.step = [[0 for col in range(self.grid.width)] for row in range(6)]
```

On key input we'll look for key-down events in the top six rows:

```python
def on_grid_key(self, x, y, s):
    # toggle steps
    if s == 1 and y < 6:
        self.step[y][x] ^= 1
        self.draw()
```

We will build the LED display from scratch each time we need to refresh. This will be done inside of `draw()`. Below we simply copy the `step` data to the `led` array, doing the proper multiplication by 11 in order to get almost-full brightness. Also note that we initialize `buffer` on each redraw, which gives us a blank canvas.

```python
def draw(self):
    buffer = monome.GridBuffer(self.grid.width, self.grid.height)

    # display steps
    for x in range(self.grid.width):
        for y in range(6):
            buffer.led_level_set(x, y, self.step[y][x] * 11)
```

That'll get us started.

### 2.2 Play

*See grid-studies-2-2.py for this section.*

On each iteration inside `play()` we process the next step, which in this case simply means incrementing `play_position`. This value must be wrapped to 0 if it's at the end.

```python
async def play(self):
    while True:
        if self.play_position == self.grid.width - 1:
            self.play_position = 0
        else:
            self.play_position += 1
```

The playback rate is controlled by the time interval between `play()` iterations:

```python
await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
```

For the redraw we add highlighting for the play position:

```python
# display steps
for x in range(self.grid.width):
    # highlight the play position
    if x == self.play_position:
        highlight = 4
    else:
        highlight = 0

    for y in range(6):
        buffer.led_level_set(x, y, self.step[y][x] * 11 + highlight)
```

During this loop which copies steps to the grid, we check if we're updating a column that is the play position. If so, we increase the highlight value. By adding this value during the copy we'll get a nice effect of an overlaid translucent bar.

### 2.3 Triggers

*See grid-studies-2-3.py for this section.*

When the playhead advances to a new row we want something to happen which corresponds to the toggled-on rows. We'll do two things: we'll show separate visual feedback on the grid in the second-to-last (trigger) row, and we'll print something to the command line.

Drawing the trigger row happens entirely in the `draw()`:

```python
# draw trigger bar and on-states
for x in range(self.grid.width):
    buffer.led_level_set(x, 6, 4)

for y in range(6):
    if self.step[y][self.play_position] == 1:
        buffer.led_level_set(self.play_position, 6, 15)
```

First we create a dim row (level 4 is fairly dim). Then we search through the `step` array at the current play position, showing a bright indicator for each on state. This displays a sort of horizontal correlation of rows (or "channels") 1-6 current state.

For the screen drawing, we create a function `trigger()` which gets passed values of activated steps. This is what we do, inside `draw()` right after we change `play_position`:

```python
# TRIGGER SOMETHING
for y in range(6):
    if self.step[y][self.play_position] == 1:
        self.trigger(y)
```

And then `trigger()` itself:

```python
def trigger(self, i):
    print("triggered", i)
```

This could of course be something much more exciting-- MIDI notes, robot arms, explosions, etc.

### 2.4 Cutting

*See grid-studies-2-4.py for this section.*

We will now use the bottom row to dynamically cut the playback position. First let's add a position display to the last row, which will be inside `draw()`:

```python
# draw play position
buffer.led_level_set(self.play_position, 7, 15)
```

Now we look for key presses in the last row, in the `grid_key` function:

```python
# cut
elif y == 7:
    # cut
    if s == 1:
        self.cutting = True
        self.next_position = x
```

We've added two variables, `cutting` and `next_position`. Check out the changed code where we check the timer:

```python
async def play(self):
    while True:
        if self.cutting:
            self.play_position = self.next_position
        elif self.play_position == self.grid.width - 1:
            self.play_position = 0
        else:
            self.play_position += 1
```

Now, when pressing keys on the bottom row it will cue the next position to be played.

### 2.5 Loop

*See grid-studies-2-5.py for this section.*

Lastly, we'll implement setting the loop start and end points with a two-press gesture: pressing and holding the start point, and pressing an end point while still holding the first key. We'll need to add a variable to count keys held, one to track the last key pressed, and variables to store the loop positions.

```python
def on_grid_ready(self):
    ...
    self.loop_start = 0
    self.loop_end = self.grid.width - 1
    self.keys_held = 0
    self.key_last = 0
```

We count keys held on the bottom row thusly:

```python
self.keys_held = self.keys_held + (s * 2) - 1
```

By multiplying `s` by 2 and then subtracting one, we add one on a key down and subtract one on a key up.

We'll then use the `keys_held` counter to do different actions:

```python
# cut
if s == 1 and self.keys_held == 1:
    self.cutting = True
    self.next_position = x
    self.key_last = x
# set loop points
elif s == 1 and self.keys_held == 2:
    self.loop_start = self.key_last
    self.loop_end = x
```

We then modify the position change code:

```python
async def play(self):
    while True:
        if self.cutting:
            self.play_position = self.next_position
        elif self.play_position == self.grid.width - 1:
            self.play_position = 0
        elif self.play_position == self.loop_end:
            self.play_position = self.loop_start
        else:
            self.play_position += 1
```

Done!


## Closing

### Suggested Excercises

- Implement an `on_grid_disconnect` method to stop playback when the grid is disconnected.
- "Record" keypresses in the "trigger" row to the toggle matrix.
- Display the loop range on the bottom row of the grid.
- Use the rightmost key in the "trigger" row as an "alt" key.
    - If "alt" is held while pressing a toggle, clear the entire row.
    - If "alt" is held while pressing the play row, reverse the direction of play.
