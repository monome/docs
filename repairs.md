### [contact help@monome.org](mailto:help@monome.org)

modules damaged by power handling are not warrantied, but we can certainly still fix them. other problems we can assess individually.

please be very specific about your grid or arc edition. see the [editions description](/docs/editions) if you need help identifying the generation of your device. include a photo if needed.

please include your mailing address so we can estimate shipping costs.

when shipping anything to us, be sure to include a printed sheet inside the box with your contact information, mailing address, and the problem. please insure your package when shipping.
