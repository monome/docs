# Ansible

*Far communicator, speaks openly.*

Connects to Grids, Arcs, and MIDI devices, integrating external controllers into the modular environment. Also extends Teletype. Many modes are available, activated by connecting different USB devices and a preset key:

* [Kria](/docs/ansible/kria) (Grid) live step sequencer, polyphasic parameters, emergent patterns.
* [Meadowphysics](/docs/ansible/meadowphysics) (Grid) rhizomatic cascading counter.
* [Earthsea](/docs/ansible/earthsea) (Grid) polyphonic pattern instrument.
* [Levels](/docs/ansible/levels) (Arc) rotational pattern instrument.
* [Cycles](/docs/ansible/cycles) (Arc) physically manipulated waves.
* [(Teletype)](/docs/ansible/teletype) further ecosystem output and input, and remote control of other apps.
* [(MIDI)](/docs/ansible/midi) device voice allocation and various arpeggiation.

**Grid, Arc, MIDI device, or Teletype required.**

* Eurorack
* 6hp width
* 39mm depth

## Installation

Align the 10-pin ribbon cable so the red stripe corresponds to the white indicator on the rear of the module's circuit board. This is toward the lower edge of the module.

Be careful not to misalign the connector left-to-right either - while Ansible is protected against incorrect connection, doing so may damage other modules in your Eurorack case.

If you wish Ansible to communicate with Teletype you will need to attach the [ii](/docs/modular/ii) ribbon cable behind the panel. Be sure to align the red stripe on the cable with the white line on the board.

Secure the module with the two included screws.

*Power consumption:*

These are maximums. Power consumption varies greatly based on which USB controller is attached and how many LEDs are being lit. You can drastically lower your +12V consumption by using a [Switch](/docs/switch/) (discontinued), [Offworld](https://github.com/monome/offworld-1) (DIY), or some commercial adapter cables (see [here](https://llllllll.co/t/usb-power-ground-management/20386)) with your USB controller.

- 200mA @ +12V
- 19ma @ -12V
- No +5v required

## Firmware Updates

Ansible ships with a strange USB A-A cable. This is used for firmware updates. We expect to be adding features from time to time, and the Ansible is a good candidate for community hacking. It's suggested to update your firmware to ensure you're running the newest version-- so the following documentation will be applicable rather than confusing.

Firmware update information [instructions are available](/docs/modular/update/). Be warned that updating your firmware will erase all presets from the module's internal storage! To preserve your work, you can back up Ansible's presets to a USB disk and restore this file after reflashing the module's firmware.

## Firmware Version

This documentation documents firmware version **2.0.0**. Changelogs and binaries for previous releases can be found [here](https://github.com/monome/ansible/releases). For versions 2.0.0 and up, you can determine the firmware version of your module by performing a USB disk backup. The created `ansible-preset.json` file will list the `"version":` at the beginning of the file.

## Basics

Output and input functionality vary according to which application is running.

Applications are determined by which USB device is plugged in. For example, when you plug in a Grid after a firmware update, it will be running Kria. Hold the MODE key (next to the USB port) to switch to Meadowphysics; push it again to switch to Earthsea. Ansible will remember which application you were last running between power-ups.

Unplugging the Grid and plugging an Arc will change to Levels.

With nothing plugged in the Ansible works as a Teletype input/output extender.

Modes are indicated with a white or orange LED near the mode key. Earthsea is indicated with both LEDs on, giving a "whitish-orange" colour.

## USB disk mode

If you insert a USB disk into Ansible, you can save presets to a JSON
file on disk, or restore presets from such a file. In addition to
archiving or sharing app presets, this can be useful for making
backups before updating to a new firmware revision, because future
versions will be able to load files saved by older versions. The drive
must be formatted with a FAT filesystem, FAT32 is probably your best
bet. Note that Ansible can be a little picky about USB disks it will
talk to, it's possible you may need to try a couple for this to
work. If you attach an [FTDI cable](/docs/modular/dev), Ansible prints
a fair amount of diagnostic information to the UART which may be
helpful for troubleshooting loading errors.

To save presets:

* Press KEY 2. the white LED turns on to indicate that the device is
  armed for saving.

* Press the MODE key to cancel, or press KEY 2 again to write the
  presets Ansible has stored in flash to the file
  `ansible-presets.json` on the root of the drive.

An existing `ansible-presets.json` file will be overwritten. The white
LED blinks while saving and turns off when done. Wait for this LED and
any busy indicator on the disk to stop blinking before removing the
drive, or the file may be corrupted. If an error is encountered during
writing the backup, both the white and orange LEDs will turn on until
the drive is removed or the MODE key is pressed. A full save takes
about 20 seconds.

To load presets:

* Press KEY 1. The ORANGE LED turns on to indicate that the device is
  armed for loading.

* Press the MODE key to cancel, or press KEY 1 again to read a
  `ansible-presets.json` file from the disk into Ansible's flash
  storage.

The orange LED blinks while reading and turns off when done. Wait for
this LED and any busy indicator on the disk to stop blinking before
removing the drive. If an error is encountered during loading the
backup, both the white and orange LEDs will turn on until the drive is
removed or the MODE key is pressed. Before loading, Ansible makes an
additional backup of its flash contents in the file
`ansible-backup.bin`, and will attempt to restore presets from this
file if they were partially overwritten by a load operation that did
not complete successfully. If this happens for some unforeseen reason, it may be
possible to recover your Ansible presets from this file, please post
on [lines](https://llllllll.co/t/preset-save-to-usb-disk/10113). A
full load takes about 20 seconds.

To save or load presets for only the currently running app, hold the
MODE key while inserting the disk. This can take
considerably less time than saving/loading everything, and for some apps
is fast enough that the LED won't have time to blink at all.

The JSON files are fairly human-editable, but modifying them with
out-of-bounds data may result in strange Ansible behavior.

If you are running an Ansible firmware version that does not support
disk backups (v1.6.1 or lower), or you have an `ansible.hex` file from
an older firmware, it is possible to convert a direct backup of a
firmware image (`ansible.hex`) into JSON files that newer Ansible
firmwares can load, and "carry forward" your existing presets to the
latest firmware. This conversion is done via the
[extract](https://github.com/monome/ansible/tree/master/tools/flash_tools)
Python program. If you need help converting a backup, please post on
[lines](https://llllllll.co/t/preset-save-to-usb-disk/10113) and
include the firmware version you are starting from in your post if
known.

## Tuning

It is possible to correct for mismatches between CV outputs or to
entirely reprogram Ansible's tuning table. Scales may be loaded from a
JSON preset file, or may be modified with a Grid interface via the
tuning page.

First, enter Kria. Hold Key 2 (config). The
Scale page key from Kria remains highlighted with Key 2 held. Press it
to enter tuning mode. You can let go of Key 2 now to stay in tuning mode,
and tap Key 2 again at any time to go back to Kria.

The top four rows, as in Kria's trigger page, correspond to tracks,
with the center 12 keys highlighted to represent the 12 note slots in
the tuning table between two "octaves".  An *octave* in this section
will mean a group of 12 note slots, where the first note slot in an
octave group is the octave's *waypoint*.  The currently selected note
slot is brightly highlighted, and the currently playing note slots are
highlighted for all tracks.

All tracks and therefore all trigger outputs are on by default. You
can toggle trigger outputs off and on with the leftmost column of the
top 4 rows. Touching the same note slot key that is already selected a
second time will also toggle the corresponding track's trigger output.

The bottom two rows control the pitch of the selected note slot
relative to its current value.  The bottom row provides keys for
increasing (keys on the right) or decreasing (keys on the left) the
value that will be sent to the DAC to set the pitch CV when the
currently selected note slot is played. From the center out these are
+/- 1, 2, 4, 8, ... +/- 128 on the outermost keys. Increments which
would go out of bounds have their corresponding keys unlit, so in
the initial position the left side of this row is off.

The row above the bottom row displays and sets the absolute DAC value
of the note slot. As the DAC value increases, the leftmost key will
get brighter, then it will turn off and the next key over will get
brighter, etc., with keys that have already been passed staying dimly
lit, visualizing the full CV range of the track. You can touch a key
on this row to jump quickly between DAC values.

The 10 keys on the left side of the next row up are for selecting an
octave -- you can pick one of ten banks of 12 note slots each.
The right side of this row (third from the bottom) is for load/save functionality.

* The key to the left which is separate from the other two is the
  panic key -- press it to restore your saved tuning table from flash,
  long-press it to go back to the factory default equal temperament
  tuning table. This long press does not save anything, so you can
  quick press the key again to go back to the tuning table you have
  saved, if that's different from the factory default.

* The first key on the right is for interpolating the tuning table
  between octave values. Quick press it to do a piecewise-linear fit
  between the values programmed for each octave. Long press it to fit
  between octaves and then save. What this means is that a straight
  line will be drawn between each waypoint, that is, the first note
  slot of each octave, and note slots in between will be assigned the
  values along that line. This makes it possible to define different
  CV responses for each output, such as one that gets lower in pitch
  as the note index increases, or one that gets lower in the middle,
  or an S-curved response that changes frequency more rapidly toward
  the center of the note range.

* The key furthest to the right can be long-pressed to save all note
  slots with their tunings exactly as currently programmed.

You can leave the tuning page to experiment with your tuning on other
Grid apps, but note that tuning changes are not saved to flash until
you explicitly save them using one of the rightmost keys on the third
row up of the tuning page.
