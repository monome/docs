# return policy

## process

1. within 7 days of delivery, email `help@monome.org` to arrange a return. if you're in the US, we'll email you a USPS return label. if you're outside of the US, we'll ask you to arrange return delivery using your preferred international shipping provider.
2. re-pack item(s) in their original packaging, as you received them. if any item had its own box, please repack it in a larger package -- do not repurpose the item's box as a sole shipping package.
3. once we receive the return, any item(s) in new/unused condition will receive a full refund (minus any shipping costs which were paid by monome). any used item(s) will be subject to a restocking fee as outlined below (minus any shipping costs which were paid by monome).

## restocking

| condition | details | fee |
| --- | --- | --- |
| unopened + unused | item is returned exactly as received | n/a |
| used, like-new | item is returned with all original packaging and accessories, item has no visible wear | 10% |
| used | item is returned without original packaging or accessories, item has visible wear | 20+%, determined after appraisal |
| defective | item is not working as expected | n/a |

# warranty

monome is a very tiny organization (three people), operating at human scale. we take great care to ensure all items sent from our NY workshop are in optimal working condition by partnering with local circuit board manufacturers, assembling each unit by hand, and packing them with care.

if you receive an item which is not up to performance standard, please let us know as soon as you can by emailing `help@monome.org`. we will work with you to swap the item or arrange a return.

every item purchased from monome is backed by a two year warranty to fully cover manufacturing failure (shipping costs are not covered). if any item fails during regular use within two years of purchase, please let us know as soon as it happens by emailing `help@monome.org`. be sure to include your order number, as well as a description of the trouble.

if you are not the original owner or if the item is older than two years, we will still do everything we can to keep our devices out of landfills. we offer incredibly reasonable repairs through our workshop (typically $50-$75 USD + shipping) and guidance for any applicable at-home service. just reach out to us by emailing `help@monome.org` with a description of the issue, including any photos or videos which would help us precisely identify the best course of action.
