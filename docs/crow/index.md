# Crow

Crow speaks and listens and remembers bits of text. A scriptable USB-CV-II machine.

Crow communicates Lua via USB in clear text:

```
to crow >     print("caw!")
crow says >   caw!
```

Which allows the weaving of musical structure:

```
to crow >     x = math.random(12)
              print(x)
crow says >   3
to crow >     output[1].slew = 0.9
              output[1].volts = x

(CV output 1 ramps to 3 volts over 0.9 seconds)
```

Crow integrates with norns, and also connects to computers running Max, Max for Live, and other applications which speak serial. We created a simple application called Druid to facilitate conversation. Crow becomes a programmable CV and II interface.

Crow also stores a complete script, so that without a USB connection it can continue to run, responding to CV input and II messages.

A collaboration by Whimsical Raps and monome.


## Specifications

- Eurorack, 2hp width, 41mm depth
- Power consumption: 60mA @ +12v, -15mA @ -12V, no 5V
- 2 input, 4 output, 16bit [-5V,10V] range
- Rear II connector with switchable pullups
- 3.5mm stereo MIDI input on top jack
- full Lua scripting environment


## Installation

Align the 10-pin ribbon cable so the red stripe corresponds to the white indicator on the rear of the moduleâ€™s circuit board. This is toward the lower edge of the module.

If you would like to use the II functionality, be sure to observe the orientation of the connector. The white stripe indicates GND.
