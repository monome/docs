# maps

to supplement crow's [script reference](https://monome.org/docs/crow/reference/), which outlines each individual crow command in a factual manner, **maps** offers a musical framework through which to explore. these videos originate as livestreams and are uploaded for asynchronous viewing.

this section of the docs stores text companions to the 'fundamental learning' sections of these videos. here, you'll find code and reflections on some of the compositional scenarios Trent explores in the full-length episodes.
