# Crow

Crow speaks and listens and remembers bits of text. A scriptable USB-CV-II machine.

Crow connects to norns and computers running Max, Max for Live, and other serial-enabled applications. We've created various norns scripts and Max for Live devices which require no programming, and we've also created tutorials and studies to get you started quickly programming your own ideas into this tiny, powerful module.

Crow communicates Lua via USB in clear text:

```
to crow >     print("caw!")
crow says >   caw!
```

Which allows the weaving of musical structure:

```
to crow >     x = math.random(12)
              print(x)
crow says >   3
to crow >     output[1].slew = 0.9
              output[1].volts = x

(CV output 1 ramps to 3 volts over 0.9 seconds)
```

Crow also stores a complete script, so that without a USB connection it can continue to run, responding to CV input and II messages.

A collaboration by Whimsical Raps and monome.


## Specifications

- Eurorack, 2hp width, 41mm depth
- Power consumption: 60mA @ +12v, -15mA @ -12V, no 5V
- 2 input, 4 output, 16bit [-5V,10V] range
- Rear II connector with software-switchable pullups
- full Lua scripting environment


## Installation

Align the 10-pin ribbon cable so the red stripe corresponds to the white indicator on the rear of the moduleâ€™s circuit board. This is toward the lower edge of the module.

If you would like to use the II functionality, be sure to observe the orientation of the connector. The white stripe indicates GND.

## Norns

Crow integrates seamlessly with norns as a CV and II interface.

First, be sure to [update](https://monome.org/docs/norns/#update) your norns software and then get the newest version of [awake](https://llllllll.co/t/awake/21022) and [ash](https://llllllll.co/t/ash-a-small-collection/21349). These scripts have new crow integration, and watch the [Library](https://llllllll.co/c/library) for more.

Scripting for crow is simple:

```
crow.output[1].volts = 3.3      -- set output 1 to 3.3V

crow.ii.jf.mode(1)              -- via ii, enable JF mode 1
crow.ii.jf.play_note(1.0,5.0)   -- via ii, play JF note 1V at 5V amplitude
```

See the full [crow studies](norns) for a complete guide.


## Max

**@dndrks**

To utilize the `crow` object in Max/MSP, you'll want to drop the entire `crow_max` folder into Max's search path. There are two ways to do this: (a.) add the folder to your current User Library or (b.) create your own path directly to the folder. We suggest (a.), since it's a bit cleaner.

a. Open Max > Options > File Preferences > highlight User Library > the rightmost icon in the bottom bar should illuminate. Clicking this icon will open the User Library folder, where you can drop the `crow_max` folder. Restart Max and you should be able to instantiate the `crow` object!

b. Open Max > Options > File Preferences > the leftmost icon in the bottom bar (+) will allow you to define your own user path. You'll see a new entry appear at the bottom of the list. Select 'choose' in the Path column and select your downloaded `crow_max` folder.

## Max for Live

**@dndrks**

After downloading the `crow_m4l` folder, place it wherever you'd prefer on your harddrive. Open Ableton Live 9 or 10 and drag the folder into Live's browser, under PLACES.

If you are updating a previous installation, just replace the previous `crow_m4l` folder's contents with the new files.

## Updates

[current firmware version](https://github.com/monome/crow/releases)

You can check the version of the firmware on a crow several ways:

- Norns: open maiden and type `crow.version()` into the command prompt REPL.
- Druid: type `^^version`.
- Max/M4l: **@dndrks** maybe have it printed somewhere on connect??
