# applications

open source! many of the applications require [Max](http://cycling74.com) which includes a free runtime.

contact `help@monome.org` to have your application listed. we suggest [github](http://github.com) for hosting your project.

## archives

[collected](https://github.com/monome-community/collected) is a large unsorted repository of applications contributed over the years. we've also collected numerous [old monomeserial applications](https://github.com/monome-community/collected-ms) which are basically obsolete, but could be updated easily given some small ambition.
