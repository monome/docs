# applications

norns is uniquely oriented toward sharing. In the early days of monome, creating apps for grid and arc was relatively straightforward but there were also a lot of dependencies -- the biggest being operating systems. norns successfully navigates around this by decoupling its dependence on Windows or Mac OS. Additionally, the scripting syntax at its heart is pliable and it's incredibly easy to adapt chunks of code from others to create your dream instruments.

While this is not a comprehensive list of what's available (or even all of our favorites!), these projects are a wonderful starting point for those looking to play, adapt, and develop. [Click here to view the complete library](https://llllllll.co/search?expanded=true&q=%23library%20tags%3Anorns%20order%3Alatest_topic).

All of the projects in this section are available for download in maiden's [project manager](/docs/norns/maiden/#project-manager). Each name links back to its discussion thread on lines.

## sampling + looping

*norns has a built-in realtime sampling layer called `softcut`. It is always running and is able to capture external audio or sounds from the engines on norns. Apps in this section control softcut. Want to build your own or have an idea to extend one of these apps? Check out the [softcut studies](https://llllllll.co/t/norns-softcut-studies/23585).*

- **[compass](https://llllllll.co/t/compass/25192)**: Asynchronous looper built around the concept of a command-based sequencer. Commands modulate recording, playback, looping, even sequencing behaviors.
- **[otis](https://llllllll.co/t/22149)**: Dual "tape" delay/looper/sampler with digital noise, inspired by Peter Blasser's Cocoquantus. Includes `hnds`, a bank of LFOs that can be used to modulate panning, volume, feedback, speed, record state, direction, and position of the buffer playback.
- **[mlr](https://llllllll.co/t/mlr-norns/21145)**: The original live sample-cutting platform. Load samples or record live audio, then re-pitch + chop + record gestures.
- **[cranes](https://llllllll.co/t/cranes/21207)**: Stereo varispeed looper / delay / timeline-smoosher. On-the-fly sampling into a 60-second buffer, snapshot function to capture/recall sets of start/end points and playback speed/direction.
- **[tunnels](https://llllllll.co/t/tunnels/21973)**: A collection of randomized, experimental stereo delays. Flip through a plethora of preset modes (with delightfully esoteric names) for immediate fun.
- **[reels](https://llllllll.co/t/reels/21030)**: 4-track asynchronous looper, inspired by OP-1's tape recorder and the Whimsical Raps w/ Eurorack module. Includes library version (`libreels`) to easily add reels to any other scripts which do not yet utilize softcut.
- **[TimeParty](https://llllllll.co/t/timeparty/22837)**: Delay with seven step sequencers to modulate time, rate, feedback, autopanning, reverb, filter cutoff, and position.

## synth engines + sequencers

*Many sequencers rely on synth engines which must be installed beforehand. To help keep this front-of-mind, we will list the synth engine and then the sequencers which utilize it. Unless otherwise noted, all engines can be downloaded through maiden's [project manager](/docs/norns/maiden/#project-manager), under `community`. Remember that after installing a new synth engine, you need to restart norns (SYSTEM > RESET) in order for SuperCollider to register it.*

*When applicable, engines are hyperlinked to their lines discussion thread.*

### **[glut](https://llllllll.co/t/glut/21175)**
Granular synth inspired by mlr/rove, grainfields and loomer cumulus. Includes a default script which uses grid to trigger sample playback, mute tracks and record patterns.

The following apps also use glut:

- **[langl](https://llllllll.co/t/langl/26931)**: Granular looper for arc. Tactile control over grain clouds: pitch, density, size, jitter, spread, volume, speed, loop location.
- **[mangl](https://llllllll.co/t/mangl/21066)**: Sample player + manipulator for grid + arc. Quickly manipulate up to seven samples (and the sounds in between) to create new landscapes from familiar material.

### **[Molly the Poly](https://llllllll.co/t/molly-the-poly/21090)**
Classic polysynth with solar system patch creator. Juno-6 voice structure with chorus, the extra modulation of a Jupiter-8, and CS-80 inspired ring modulation. Engine has a default script to play the synth with grid or MIDI.

The following apps also use Molly the Poly:

- **[fugu](https://llllllll.co/t/fugu/21033)**: Multi-playhead sequencer inspired by "Fugue Machine" for iOS. Also speaks MIDI to sequence external instruments.
- **[loom](https://llllllll.co/t/loom/21091) + [traffic]((https://llllllll.co/t/traffic/21262))**: Surprisingly controllable generative sequencer. Think flin-meets-snake; notes are played when threads moving across the X and Y axis collide. **traffic** is the arc-enabled version, which also decouples motifs from their harmonic framework.
- **[the arp index](https://llllllll.co/t/the-arp-index/25182)**: Check stocks on norns (and make music). Listen to the sound of stocks falling, invest to push up the last note of your arpeggiator, do money things on norns. Also speaks MIDI to sequence external instruments.
